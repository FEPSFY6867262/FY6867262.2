    <h1>Development of Precision Tools for Manufacturing</h1>
    <div class="section">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
     Precision tools are fundamental to modern manufacturing, enabling the creation of intricate and high-quality components with exceptional accuracy. These tools are indispensable in industries like aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and electronics, where even minor deviations can lead to critical failures. The demand for greater precision, reliability, and efficiency has driven continuous innovation, shaping the landscape of precision tool development. This article explores the history, technologies, applications, challenges, and prospects of precision tools, highlighting their transformative impact on manufacturing.

        <h2>The Evolution of Precision Tools</h2>
        <p>
        The journey of precision tools began with simple, manual instruments designed for artisans. Tools like callipers and gauges were foundational to early manufacturing but offered limited precision. The Industrial Revolution introduced mechanised tools that enabled mass production, although the precision was still suboptimal. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A significant leap occurred with the advent of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems in the mid-20th century. These systems, integrated with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), automated machining processes and achieved unprecedented levels of precision. Modern CNC tools run with tolerances as tight as Â±1 micron, essential for industries like aerospace and medical device manufacturing (Groover, 2019). 
        </p>
        <p>
        Recent advancements in digital technology, materials science, and sensor integration have further refined precision tools, elevating their accuracy and functionality.
